				<h2>Beatport Pro - 80/20</h2>
			 	<p>I feel <a href="https://pro.beatport.com/" />Beatport Pro</a> offers a good example of a website designing for the 20% in the 80/20 rule. To me, it offers a simple solution for the DJs that come there to buy large ammounts of songs to play live. Searching by genre really helps DJs build a set to play. Since it doesn't offer full length songs, it is almost reserved for DJs that will be playing to crowds and people that are interested in the top songs of different genres.</p>

				<h2>Squarespace - Affordance</h2>
				<p><a href="http://www.squarespace.com/" />Squarespace</a> offers many examples of affordances. On the homepage, an arrow is at the bottom which for some, may afford clicking, and others, scrolling. The page also takes advantage of parallax scrolling which makes one want to keep scrolling to see what comes next.</p>

				<h2>Google Search - Signal to Noise</h2>
				<p>Everyone knows about <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>. There are normally a few ads on the page, but they don't detract from the 'signal' on the page, and many times, are exactly what we are looking for. The design also helps keep noise to a minimum by using pale colors for ads and dark colors for important aspects.</p>

				<h2>UStream - Rule of Thirds</h2>
				<p>I find <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/">UStream</a> to be a perfect example of a webpage using the rule of thirds. First, the page makes use of vertical thirds with the "For Broadcasters," "For Teams," and "For Marketers" sections. It also makes use of horizontal thirds with these buttons with the middle of the buttons falling on the bottom third line.</p>

				<h2>CatScarf - Chunking</h2>
				<p>C<a href="http://www.catscarf.com/">atScarf</a> makes great use of chunking. To illustrate this, I took a screenshot of the entire page. The scarves are simply chunked out by year and then there are some photos and short biographical information about the company. Also, each of these specific sections use the entire height of the screen.</p>
