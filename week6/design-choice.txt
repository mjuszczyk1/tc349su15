For me, I think it was better to do a full comp. A style tile is a nice place to start and helped me think about color schemes and an overall style of the website, but I kind of felt constrained to what the style tile asked for. I also like full comps because they help me visualize a more finalized version of the layout and grid of the website. I don't think I could have gotten by with just a Style Tile, but it did help me think critically about styles that would eventually be on my page. A full comp is much easier to work off of in my opinion. I probably spent the most time on the Style Tiles, but I think that's just because I'm not used to using Photoshop - I normally use InDesign. That being said, I did find Photoshop easier to be more creative graphically than InDesign.
